# School Management System 
- This project is a School Management System implemented using SQL on the command prompt through the XAMPP server. The system is designed to handle various school operations using a relational database model. The project incorporates fundamental database concepts, such as key constraints (primary and foreign keys), and includes complex SQL queries like joins to manage and extract data effectively. The system uses sample data to demonstrate various functionalities, including student management, teacher assignments, and course scheduling, without a frontend interface.


## Features:
- **Student Management:** Manage student records.
- **Teacher Management:** Manage Teacher records.
- **Management of Parents Record:** Manage parents records.
- **Administration Management:** Manage Administration records.
- **Key Constraints:** Utilizes primary and foreign keys for data integrity.
- **Complex Queries:** Includes joins, aggregations, and subqueries to fetch relevant data.

# Technologies Used:
- **SQL**
- **XAMPP Server**

## Setup Instructions:
1. Install XAMPP on your system.
2. Launch the XAMPP Control Panel and start the MySQL service.
3. Open the command prompt and connect to MySQL using the following command:
- mysql -u root -p

4. Create the necessary database and tables using the provided SQL scripts.
5. Populate the database with the sample data.
6. Run SQL queries to interact with the system and fetch data.

## Data Management:
- Primary Key: Ensures unique identification of records.
- Foreign Key: Maintains referential integrity between related tables.
## Usage:
-This project is designed for educational purposes and can be extended further with a frontend interface and additional functionalities.
